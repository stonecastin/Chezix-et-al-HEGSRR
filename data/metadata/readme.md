# River-Network-Flow-Trends

The following R code files and markdown manuscript use flow data pulled from Environment Canada's HYDAT data base. The data are parsed into monthly and annual increments and statistically analyzed using generalized least squares models to determine flow trends over a 38 year period. The goal of this project is to determine how the strength and direction of flow trends vary among sites with increasing catchment size. Do river networks integrate varying flow trends such that an averaging affect occurs over space and time to buffer against the shifting climate?
